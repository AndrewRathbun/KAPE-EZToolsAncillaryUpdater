# KAPE-EZToolsAncillaryUpdater
A script that updates KAPE (using `Get-KAPEUpdate.ps1`) as well as EZ Tools (within `.\KAPE\Modules\bin`) and the ancillary files that enhance the output of those tools

## What Does "Ancillary" mean?

Per Google, `ancillary` means:
  
> providing necessary support to the primary activities or operation of an organization, institution, industry, or system.
    
Used in a sentence:
    
> the development of ancillary services to support its products

In the context of this script, KAPE Targets/Modules, EvtxECmd Maps, SQLECmd Maps, and RECmd Batch files are ancillary to their respective tools. Each of these files enhance the output of the tools. Keeping them updated is often overlooked but very important to ensuring that you're benefitting from the latest features/bug fixes from Eric and the latest work from the DFIR community.

# Improving the Script
Do you see something that could be done better with this script? Create an issue or do a Pull Request, if so! This is the first script I've put together on my own so I have no doubts there's room for improvement. Anything that moves the ball forward and helps the DFIR community I will always be in full support of!
